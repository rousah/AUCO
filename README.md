# AUCO

## ¿What is AUCO?
AUCO is a gamified online tool made with React that focuses on helping primary and middle school teachers to fight against bullying, in terms of detection and mitigation, and offering an open space where the students can communicate their worries to their teachers.

The back-end of this proyect is hosted in [AUCO-server](https://github.com/rousah/AUCO-server).

## ¿How does it work?
In the platform, the students are asked to answer specific questionnaires, that are validated in their use to detect bullying cases. Gamification is used to motivate students to use the online tool, and the teacher receives notifications regarding the possible bullying-cases.

## Quick start AUCO

```bash
cd auco
npm start
